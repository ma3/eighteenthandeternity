Thought process: Imagining a remote-based Agile team, testing Requirement list layouts for ease of development

Status list:
Unassigned - Yet to be reviewed, unknown debt resolution time, user submitted
Wishlist - Big picture, preferred scalability, major version user submitted feature requests
Corrections - Reviewed as minor version code failure
Failures - Reviewed as major version code failure

Wishlist breakdown:
Single Sprint - Minor functionality
Minor Version - code change
Major Version - system and/or infrastructure change

Thought process: Wanting a database structure to list in at this point. Rough outline:
CREATE TABLE requirements (req_id int, title_id, subject, status_id );

Any given requirement should be in this format:
<Area>,<File>,<Status>,<Time>,<succinct subject>,<complete requirement>

Thought process: Rough outline is done, so I can go back and reference it when I get lost later.

<Area>,<File>,<Status>,<Time>,<succinct subject>,<complete requirement>
